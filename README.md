# Android Open Source User Interface Project
(kinda long name tbh)

## Setting up your machine
You must be running the latest Figma version or web interface.
Figma recommends macOS but everyone is not rich so use Windows or Linux like everyone.

## Grabbing the source
You just need your device codename and screen resolution.
Not too hard ?

## Syncing
There's no 2 hour syncing to do, just download the **source-aosuip.fig** file

## Building
![Guide](https://i.imgur.com/URXrErz.png "Guide")
On Guide/About, change your device codename.
On Status bar Guide, change the status bar do adapt to the screen corners/notch.
Then, change the screen height to your device's one.
Just export the images and you're done ;)
